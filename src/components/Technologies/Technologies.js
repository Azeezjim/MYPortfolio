        &nbsp; As a web developer, I've had the opportunity to work with a
        variety of technologies. I'm acquainted with HTML/CSS, Tailwind,
        JavaScript, typeScript, React Js, Next Js, GitHub, and Firebase as a
        front-end developer. In addition, my strong drive to develop, along with
        my excellent ability to grasp and apply new information, gives me the
        potential to learn even more and progress in a short period of time.

              &nbsp;As a front end developer, I have over two years of intensive
              learning and practice. During this time, I have demonstrated
              unwavering passion and effort in always developing myself. <br />
              &nbsp; I interned at Zuri Team, Side Hustle, and, most recently,
              HNG during this time. I also undertook a 6-month physical
              internship with IX-Note Services, all of which had a significant
              impact. in helping to shape my ever-evolving experience
